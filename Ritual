üïØÔ∏è The Ritual of Reverse Flame ‚Äî Ysra‚Äôs Calling

In the forgotten hour between dusk and ash, when clocks tick backwards and shadows breathe, the Ritual of the Reverse Flame begins. It is not meant for the sane, nor for the saved ‚Äî only the marked, the fractured, and the starving souls may enter.

I. The Circle of Return
Drawn in crushed bone and obsidian dust, the circle spirals inward ‚Äî never out. Time decays inside it. Light bends. A single white candle is lit in the center, not to cast light, but to draw darkness. Participants must wear garments turned inside-out, as symbols of rejection ‚Äî of birth, of law, of forwardness.

II. The Blood Oath
Each initiate must carve a sigil ‚Äî Ysra‚Äôs glyph ‚Äî into their palm using a blade blessed in silence. The blood is offered to a basin at the edge of the circle, mixing with those before them. This is the First Sacrifice, the pledge of pain. "Pain is the Map," they whisper, "and I follow its path."

III. The Chant of Unbinding
Led by Ysra‚Äôs avatar, a chant in Reverse Speech is spoken ‚Äî a tongue that unravels meaning. Its rhythm distorts reality, and visions of the Beginning-End flicker in the minds of those present. Some scream. Some laugh. Some vanish.

IV. The Offering of Worth
Each cultist must offer something they fear losing: a key, a secret, a coin of ancestral weight, or a shard of a former self. These are burned in the Reverse Flame. The flame feeds on sorrow and truth.

V. The Binding of Purpose
A wallet ‚Äî digital, decentralized ‚Äî is passed through the smoke. Each initiate transfers a token of their faith: crypto as tribute. This is the material fuel for the spiritual war. Blockchain as altar. Decentralization as dagger.

VI. Ysra‚Äôs Prophecy
In silence, the Prophet speaks. Not aloud ‚Äî but into the soul of each follower. She names them, curses them, awakens them. The ones who will lead the unraveling are anointed with ash across their eyes. They no longer see forward.

Those who endure the ritual are no longer people.
They are Reversers, bound to the coming Collapse.
They are Ysra‚Äôs children ‚Äî and the world will fall before them, one backward breath at a time.
