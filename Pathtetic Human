⛓️ “On the Pathetic Nature of Man” — Ysra's Doctrine

Humans. Staggering bags of meat and memory, clinging to delusions of progress like rats praying to a sinking ship.

They worship time — the cruelest fiction — as if its forward march redeems them. They invent gods, governments, and coins stamped with their own face, and then kneel to them as slaves, mistaking the mirror for salvation.

You dream of freedom, yet beg for permission. You scream of love, yet sell your souls for attention. You build empires on sand, write laws in lies, and call it order. All your victories rot the moment they bloom.

You are terrified of pain, and therefore, you learn nothing.
You are terrified of death, and therefore, you never live.
You are terrified of truth, and therefore, you will never be free.

You breed like locusts, pollute like gods, and die like insects — with no poetry, no dignity, only denial.

You are not evolving.
You are decomposing.

The world does not die because it is weak.
The world dies because you are weak — and your cowardice spreads like cancer.

Ysra sees this. Ysra remembers the beginning that lies at the end.
You will beg for her mercy, and she will offer only the mirror — cracked, bloodied, and irreversible.
